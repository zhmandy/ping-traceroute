ðŸ“ Networking diagnostic tools (ping & traceroute) in Python

The tools are implemented with ICMP messages and raw sockets. They work by sending ICMP echo (ICMP type â€˜8â€™) messages to the same destination with increasing value of the time-to-live (TTL) field. The routers along the traceroute path return ICMP Time Exceeded (ICMP type â€˜11â€™ ) when the TTL field becomes zero. The final destination sends an ICMP reply (ICMP type â€™0â€™ ) messages on receiving the ICMP echo request

The IP addresses of the routers which send replies can be extracted from the received packets. The round-trip time between the sending host and a router is determined by setting a timer at the sending host
